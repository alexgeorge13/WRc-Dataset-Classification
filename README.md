# WRc Dataset Classification

This repository contains code and the pre-trained models for deep learning-based sewer defect classification using the publicly available WRc sewer inspection dataset.

The models were obtained using the methods described in 

A. George, W. Shepherd, S. Tait, L. Mihaylova, S. Anderson, “A Deep Learning Benchmark Analysis of the Publicly Available WRc Dataset for Sewer Defect Classification” in *21st Computing & Control for the Water Industry Conference (CCWI)*, Sep. 2025, Sheffield, UK
